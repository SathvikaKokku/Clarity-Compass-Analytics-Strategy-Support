# Clarity-Compass-Analytics-Strategy-Support
Business analytics work for Clarity Compass â€“ Word of Life Outreach Ministries, including GA4 setup, NLP-based audience research, and data visualizations to support outreach strategy.

As part of my volunteer work with Clarity Compass â€“ Word of Life Outreach Ministries, I recently led an NLP-driven analysis to uncover trending topics that matter most to our audience.

Using Python and Natural Language Processing, I collected and analyzed online discussions to identify recurring themes among women in their 30s. The result? A visual word cloud highlighting the most common words and topics shaping their conversations, emotions, and needs.

ðŸ’¡ Why it matters:
This analysis helps the team create more targeted and empathetic outreach content, ensuring our resources and programs resonate with the real challenges our audience is discussing.

Tech Highlights:

Data Collection & Cleaning with Python

Keyword Extraction & Frequency Analysis

Word Cloud Visualization for quick, impactful insights

ðŸ“Š From scattered conversations to a clear picture - turning unstructured text into actionable strategies that support meaningful community engagement.
